# Examples

This page contains examples from the official [swapi-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql).

## Query all Films

Say you want to list all films on the endpoint.

```graphql 
{% include "examples/query_all_films.graphql" %}
```

The corresponding code looks like this:

```python 
{% include "examples/query_all_films.py" %}
```

_(This example is complete and should run "as is".)_


## Query film by id

Now you've got an id and want the information for that movie.

```graphql 
{% include "examples/query_film_by_id.graphql" %}
```

The corresponding code looks like this:

```python 
{% include "examples/query_film_by_id.py" %}
```
